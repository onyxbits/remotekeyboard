/**
 * This class implements a Manager Singleton that takes care
 * for all shells to be offered.<br>
 * <p/>
 * The resources can be defined via properties that contain following
 * information:
 * <ul>
 * <li> All system defined shells:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Login: first shell run on top of the connection.
 * <li>Queue: shell thats run for connections placed into the queue.
 * <li>Admin: shell for administrative tasks around the embedded telnetd.
 * </ol>
 * <li> Custom defined shells:<br>
 * Declared as value to the <em>customshells</em> key, in form of a comma seperated
 * list of names. For each declared name there has to be an entry defining the shell.
 * </ul>
 * The definition of any shell is simply represented by a fully qualified class name, of a class
 * that implements the shell interface. Please read the documentation of this interface
 * carefully.<br>
 * The properties are passed on creation through the factory method, which is called by the
 * net.wimpi.telnetd.TelnetD class.
